* Add support for disabling `libcap` on older/embedded systems
Some older (?) UNIX systems, and some resource constrained embedded
systems in particular, may not have or need libcap.

The default should remain, to fail and warn if the user does not have
`sys/capabilities.h`, but we could add a `--disable-libcap` or similar
if the user wants to proceed anywy.

* Add IPv6 support for (*, G), i.e., on-demand, routing rules.
In SMCRoute 1.99.0 IPv4 support for source-less multicast routes was
added. Adding support for IPv6 should be fairly straight forward, but
needs figuring out the kernel interface and extensive testing.

* Support for detecting link up/down on interfaces
Also requires updating VIF/MIFs and mroutes accordingly.

Optimal, and almost required, behavior would be to handle such
transitions  without losing any traffic over established/active
routing rules.
