* BEFORE RELEASE
- Audit socket close and ipc_exit() ordering, during SIGHUP
- Add smcroutectl show <-- list both (*,G) and active kernel routes + mgroups
- Add compat.c --> old smcroute interface, --enable-old-smcroute

* Support for re-enumerating VIFs at runtime

The main requirement is to be able to add/remove interface VIF/MIF
mappings at runtime, e.g. if an interface has not yet been created when
smcrouted has started.  Currently the -t startup delay option has to be
used for this.

Optimal behavior would be to handle such transitions without losing any
traffic for already established/active routing rules.

May also require updating VIF/MIFs and mroutes accordingly.

* Support for filtering based on source ADDRESS/LEN

#+BEGIN_SRC
mroute from eth0 except 192.168.1.0/24 group 225.1.2.0/24 to eth1 eth2
#+END_SRC

* IPv6 support for (*, G), on-demand, routing rules
In SMCRoute 1.99.0 IPv4 support for source-less multicast routes was
added. Adding support for IPv6 should be fairly straight forward, but
needs figuring out the kernel interface and extensive testing.


* Add unit tests

#+BEGIN_SRC
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
make test
#+END_SRC
