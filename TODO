* Support for reloading/restarting server config on SIGHUP
Optimal behavior would be to handle this without losing any traffic
over established/active routing rules. This is however not required,
like in link up/down below...

* Support for graceful shutdown of server on SIGTERM/SIGQUIT
Maybe not necessary, kernel does all cleanup anyway?

* Support for detecting link up/down on interfaces
Also requires updating VIF/MIFs and mroutes accordingly.

Optimal, and almost required, behavior would be to handle such
transitions  without losing any traffic over established/active
routing rules.
