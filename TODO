* BEFORE RELEASE
- Audit socket close and ipc_exit() ordering
- Replace gettimeofday() with clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC), incl. configure checks
- Refactor script.c waitpid() to use SIGCHLD instead
- Add smcroutectl show <-- list both (*,G) and active kernel routes + mgroups
- Add compat.c --> old smcroute interface, --enable-old-smcroute

* Add IPv6 support for (*, G), i.e., on-demand, routing rules
In SMCRoute 1.99.0 IPv4 support for source-less multicast routes was
added. Adding support for IPv6 should be fairly straight forward, but
needs figuring out the kernel interface and extensive testing.

* Support for detecting link up/down on interfaces
Also requires updating VIF/MIFs and mroutes accordingly.

Optimal, and almost required, behavior would be to handle such
transitions  without losing any traffic over established/active
routing rules.

* Add unit tests

#+BEGIN_SRC
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
make test
#+END_SRC

* Add support for filtering based on source ADDRESS/LEN

#+BEGIN_SRC
mroute from eth0 except 192.168.1.0/24 group 225.1.2.0/24 to eth1 eth2
#+END_SRC
