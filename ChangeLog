smcroute 0.93 -> 0.94
 * Added support for IPv6 multicast routing in smcroute. SMCRoute now
	supports addition and removal of IPv6 multicast routes. It will
	automatically detect which type of route to add or delete based
	on the type (IPv4/IPv6) of addresses provided for the add and
	remove commands.
 * Added support for joins and leaves ('j'/'l') to IPv6 multicast groups.
 * Added support for sending to IPv6 multicast addresses to mcsender tool.
 * Added command line option to mcsender tool to allow user to specify the 
	outgoing interface for datagrams sent.
 * Added autoconf support for smcroute build.
	
smcroute 0.92 -> 0.93
 * fixed the "smcroute looses output interfaces" bug (Carsten Schill, 0.93
    unreleased).

smcroute 0.90 -> 0.92
  * fixed the 'mroute: pending queue full, dropping entries' error
    Smcroute 0.90 didn't care about the IGMP messages delivered to the 
    UDP socket that establish the MC-Router API. After some time the 
    queue for the sockets filled up and the 'pending queue full' message
    was send from the kernel. To my knowledge this didn't affect smcroute
    or the operating system.
    - version 0.92 reads the ICMP messages now from the UDP socket and 
      logs them to syslog with daemon/debug
    - smcroute does no further processing of this messages
  * increased the number of supported interfaces 
    The 16 interface limit of version 0.90 (interfaces as listed with 
    ifconfig) was to small, especially when alias interfaces where 
    defined.
    - up to 40 interfaces are no recognized by smcroute  
    - this does not change the number of 'virtual interfaces' supported 
      by the kernel (32)
    - not all interfaces recognized by smcroute (40) results in a 
      'virtual interface' of the kernel (32)

smcroute 0.80 -> 0.90
  * added MC group join (-j) and leave (-l) functionality 
    - the options enable/disable the sending of IGMP join messages for
      a multicast group on a specific interface
  * removed the '<OutputIntf> [<OutputIntf>] ...' for the '-r' option
    - they are not used by the kernel to identify the route to remove
    - smcroute will not complain about extra arguments for the '-r' option
      to stay compatible with releases <= 0.80
  * improved error handling for some typical error situations
  * added a test script (tst-smcroute.pl)
  * added a man page
  * fixed some minor bugs
